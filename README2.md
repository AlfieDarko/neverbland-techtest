# Developer Challenge

**Neverbland®** is committed to creating great experiences - that starts, and ends with our people and
their ability. A significant part of that process is code. So, to get to know you better, we'd like to read a
little of your code.

This challenge is open-ended, and designed to stretch your skill set. You can take it as far as you'd like,
and there's no real 'guideline time frame', other than a vacancy is only a vacancy until it's filled by a
candidate that submits something awesome.

## Objective

We'd like you to build a website based on these wireframes that consumes data from the **TV Maze API**.

### API URLs

- **TV Maze**: [https://www.tvmaze.com/api](https://www.tvmaze.com/api)
- **Schedule**: [https://www.tvmaze.com/api#schedule](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#schedule)
- **Shows**: [https://www.tvmaze.com/api#shows](https://www.tvmaze.com/api#shows)

## Requirements

- The layout should be based on the provided wireframes, however the look, feel and any
interactivity is up to you - don't be afraid to get creative!

- Work should be submitted as a Git repository. We love it as an MR/PR so we can do a code
review, but a straight-up repo works too; the feedback is just not inline.

- The site should be built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (TypeScript is always a winner). As far
as styling is concerned Tailwind or styled components are preferred.

- The site should be built using responsive techniques to behave well on a variety of devices.

- We encourage the use of a framework - our preference is Next.js.

## Taking Things Further

If you have the time to level up, here are some suggestions to enhance the app and your chances:

- Implement data validation using a library like Zod.
- Responsive images.
- Tests (Unit and/or end-to-end).
- Pagination.
- Performance optimization.
